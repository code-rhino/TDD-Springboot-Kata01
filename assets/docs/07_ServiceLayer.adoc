= Spring Boot - The Service Layer
:toc:
:toclevels: 4

Building the service layer and its unit tests

== The Service Layer

The service layer:

* breaks down the incoming request from the controller
* makes the necessary calls to the repository layers
* stitches the response Java objects
* sends them back to the API/Controller layer
* performs business logic validations
* throws the right exceptions when issues are encountered

We use an interface-implementation model here, so we have more flexibility in autowiring and testing.

. Service Interface +
⇒ link:../../phonebook/src/main/java/com/codedifferently/phonebook/widgets/services/WidgetService.java[WidgetService.java] +
.. This interface defines all the service methods that are publicly available.

. Service Implementation +
⇒ link:../../phonebook/src/main/java/com/codedifferently/phonebook/widgets/services/WidgetServiceImpl.java[WidgetServiceImpl.java] +
.. The Service implementation implements all the methods listed in the Service interface.
.. The `constructor` autowires a `WidgetRepo` interface which is made available via a Spring
context.
.. The Service implementation also includes validations of some constraints. These validations
throw necessary custom exceptions (in this example, extending the RuntimeException).

'''

== The Service unit test

The service is tested with `@SpringBootTest`.

. Test extending the abstract test setup +
⇒ link:../../phonebook/src/test/java/com/codedifferently/phonebook/widgets/services/WidgetServiceTest.java[WidgetServiceTest.java]
.. The `setUp()` method runs *_before each test method_* and adds a Mock implementation of the
repository.
.. A Mock object wraps around the actual one, and replaces certain method calls with other
functionality.
.. In this example, the mock object replaces actual database calls with fake responses simulating
a database access.
.. This test can thus run without a database.

IMPORTANT: The mock mockWidgetRepo switches functionality *_when_* a matching condition is met. The
`thenReturn` or `thenAnswer` provides a response that simulates the actual database action.

== Exercise Lab

. Create the lab service layer and unit test. Standard CRUD operations on Account plus methods for:
.. Find By lastName, should return a list.
