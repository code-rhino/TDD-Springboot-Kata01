How the Spring Boot tutorial is split.

== The domain for the chapters

The next few chapters will cover a Widget service.

The Widget service creates a RESTful service to Create, Read, Update and Delete todo instances. Each Todo instance has a:

* id: the generated ID of the Widget
* name: the name of the Widget
* widgetParts: list of WidgetParts that make the Widget

'''

== Tutorial Path

The flow of the new few sections:

* *maven* dependencies.

* *model layer* and its unit test cases.

* *repository layer*  and its unit test cases.

* *exception layer* and its unit test cases.

* *service layer* and its unit test cases.

* *controller layer* and its unit test cases.

'''

== Recommended package hierarchy for layers

It is important to layer out a spring application properly to easily test and refactor code.

The recommended approach for package hierarchy from any application / user using the Spring Boot application:

[source]
----
(controller or api) ⇛ service ⇛ (dao or repository) + model + config.
----

The logical way to code these layers will thus take a reverse approach:

* Code and unit-test the model layer.
* Code and unit-test the dao or repository layer.
* Code and unit-test the service layer.
* Code and unit-test the controller or api layer.
* Code the config layer as needed by each of the above.
