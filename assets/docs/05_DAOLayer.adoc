Building the *data access layer* (DAO) and its unit tests

== The Repository DAO Layer
Spring Data JPA takes care of most of the data access layer. +
⇒ link:../../phonebook/src/test/java/com/codedifferently/phonebook/widgets/models/repos/WidgetRepo.java[WidgetRepo.java]

. Most CRUD operations are supplied by the parent interface `JpaRepository` from Spring
(`org.springframework.data.jpa.repository` package) +
.. The `JpaRepository` extends the `PagingAndSortingRepository` which extends the `CrudRepository`.

. Custom finder methods +
.. In addition to the available-by-default CRUD operations, custom methods can be added. In the
`WidgetRepo`, a `findWidgetByName` operation is a custom find operation.
.. Constructing such custom operations requires a deeper understanding of how query methods are
generated by *Spring Data JPA*.
.. Refer to the
link:http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#jpa.query-methods.query-creation[Spring documentation]
to read up on other phrases that JPA can use for database access.

. Using named queries +
.. A named query is an operation where a custom query is annotated using a `@Query` annotation.

NOTE: The named query uses Java class and field names, rather than database table and column names.
